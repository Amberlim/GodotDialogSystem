# GodotDialogSystem 🦖
A fork of an untitled godot dialog system waiting to be named a cool name. (for Godot 4.0)

This system converts your story/dialog into a JSON file which you can then use to create your dialog in game.

*Currently in developement, so it doesn't work...*


### Brief Steps to Start Your Story
1. Open the project.gd file.
2. Enter a new or existing file name (without file extension suffix). Run the project.
3. Check ```Project>Project Settings>Autoload``` for global variables and character profiles.
4. In the visual editor, click **RUN** to save. Files will be saved at ```~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/file_name``` on Mac and ```%APPDATA%/Name``` on Windows. File named after the date and time.
